This project is an automated approach to improve Buisness Intelligence from MRO Providers (Maintenance Repair & Overhaul in the aviation industry) by combining data from several sources. Up-to-date market-insights are essential to understand customer requirements  and by using flight data, job ads, and news, our dashboards provide these insights.
